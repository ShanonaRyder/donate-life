        <h4>Our Story</h4>
        <div class="left-text">
            <p>In 1975, responding to medical advances in transplantation, local healthcare professionals formed Oregon Donor Program by bringing together organ, eye, and tissue procurement 
                agencies to collaboratively increase the local donor pool. Oregon Donor Program successfully advocated for improved donation laws, developed educational programs, 
                and conducted awareness campaigns to enlist the help of organizations, clubs, faith groups, and businesses.</p>
            <p>In 2007, Oregon Donor Program changed its name to Donate Life Northwest, reflecting the organization's commitment to educate people in Oregon and SW Washington about the 
                importance and impact of organ, eye, and tissue donation and to increase the number of people signed up on the Oregon and Washington donor registries.</p>
            <p>Donate Life Northwest, currently housed in OHSU space, is incorporated as a private nonprofit organization with 501(c)(3) tax status. Funding sources include grants, corporate 
                sponsorships and contributions, individual gifts, and member agency support.</p>
            <p>Donate Life Northwest is governed by a Board of Directors and Advisory Council. The Board of Directors is comprised of health care professionals and community leaders committed 
                to the goals of Donate Life Northwest. Donate Life Northwest is a member of Donate Life America, a national coalition founded in 1992.</p>
